# Notes

The directory `shape-library` is not currently being used (TODO verify this. what is its relationship to [xp-shapes](https://github.com/ariutta/cross-platform-shapes)?), but in the future, it could potentially be used as a component of our proposed Reusable Shape Library, which would be a collection of glyphs that people could use when drawing their diagrams.
