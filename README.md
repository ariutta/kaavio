Kaavio
====================

A component for creating custom diagram renderers. "Kaavio" is the Finnish word for diagram.

This library is not intended to be used on its own. Rather, it is to be used as a dependency for a parent library like [Pvjs](https://github.com/wikipathways/pvjs). The parent library provides one or more themes --- filters, markers, styles and symbols -- that Kaavio uses for rendering.

~~See also the [Editor Plugin](https://github.com/wikipathways/kaavio-editor), which allows for updating the pvjson data.~~ (Not ready yet.)
